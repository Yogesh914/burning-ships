# burning-ships
A program that creates a Burning Ship fractal image.

A burning ship is closely related to the Mandelbrot set. It's just not as clich√©. In a complex space, a point c=x+yi is inside the burning ship if the mapping:

is bounded. In this equation, Re(zn) means the real part of zn and Im(zn) is the imaginary part of zn. This means if you keep plugging z into the equation over and over again, the result does not become unbounded (growing bigger and bigger).
